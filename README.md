- **Structured Environment Design:** Visualize your robot's world with obstacles, boundary walls, and more.
- **Goal-Oriented Path Planning:** No more endless circumnavigation. Move towards the goal intelligently.
- **Dynamic Visualization:** Track your robot's movement step-by-step through the environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB (Version XX.X or later)

### Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/simple-robot-navigation.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory and open MATLAB.

3. Define your environment with boundaries and obstacles.

4. Set the starting and goal positions.

5. Run the script to visualize your robot's navigation.


### Example

```matlab
% Define Environment
boundary = [0, 0; 10, 0; 10, 10; 0, 10];
...
% Start and Goal Position
start = [1, 5];
goal = [9, 5];
...
% Navigate!
